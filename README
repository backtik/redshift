Red Herring
These aren't formats you're looking for.

Herring is a small webrunner based on Rack. Herring is intended to stream Ruby created documents requested via HTTP without first needing to write a normal file to disk. 

Installing
Herring can be pulled from git: http://github.com/trek/herring/tree/master
Herring requires Rack. Rack can be installed with
    sudo install gem rack

Using
Herring runs atop Rack.  You can run Herring with Rack's rackup command. The default port is :9292

    cd /path/to/your/herring
    rackup
  
You can now request files from Herring in your web browser:

http://localhost:9292/folder/file.format

Herring will parse certain Ruby formats and return their equivalent standard web format:

http://localhost:9292/folder/pretty.sass
will return Sass shaped css 

http://localhost:9292/folder/behave.red
will return Red rendered javascript 

Wha? Why?
Herring lets you use Ruby generated resources in development regardless of production environment.
